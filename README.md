# PhD Supplementary Files: *Tetramesa* phylogenetics

This GitHub repository serves as supplementary material to my PhD thesis, entitled:

**"A molecular investigation of stem-galling Tetramesa Walker (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) on African grasses: an application to biological control"**

## Instructions :pen:

Download the repository, unzip the folder, and open the R project **"PhD_curated_code"**. The R script **"data_analyses"** contains all the code used for the analyses used in my thesis. The PopArt folders contain the input files for haplotype networks in the PopArt program, for both the COI and 28S data, and the folder containing other species delimitation results are the output files from the ABGD, ASAP, PTP, bPTP, and Haplowebs (COI only).

The structure follows this order, as per the chapters in the thesis:

#### CHAPTER 2 :page_with_curl:
--- 

**PART 1: PHYLOGENY PLOTTING**    
Plots of the Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenies for the COI and 28S gene regions, and the dated 28S BEAST tree.

**PART 2: GMYC SPECIES DELIMITATION TESTS**   
Species delimitation tests using the single-threshold GMYC model on the COI and 28S FASTA alignments.

**PART 3: P-DISTANCES**   
Genetic p-distances for the COI and 28S data, and the generation of heatmaps for pairwise comparisons between clades, and barcode gap plots. Various threshold values are used to find when groups become conspecific.

**PART 4: AMOVAS FOR THE GOLDEN-SHOULDERED TETRAMESA ON ERAGROSTIS CURVULA**      
Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) for the golden-shouldered *Tetramesa* on *Eragrostis curvula* across four provinces (Eastern Cape, Free State, Mpumalanga, and the Northern Cape), and within the Eastern Cape only.

**PART 5: MANTEL TESTS: GENETIC DISTANCE VS GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE**   
Mantel tests checked whether there was a correlation between genetic distance and geographic separation for the golden-shouldered *Tetramesa* on *Eragrostis curvula*.

#### CHAPTER 3 :page_with_curl:

PART 6: COPHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES    
Global-fit cophylogenetic analyses using a wasp COI Maximum Likelihood phylogeny, and chloroplast (rpl32-trnL, rps16-trnK, and rps16) and nuclear (ITS) trees for the grasses. A PACO analysis is included with phylogenies containing representative sequences from clades.

PART 7: SPEDE-SAMPLER   
Includes all the plotting for the results obtained from the running of the SPEDE-Sampler software on the COI and 28S data.

#### MISCELLANEOUS

PART 8: MAPS: 

(1) TETRAMESA SPECIES DESCRIPTIONS GLOBALLY     
This world map shows the sampling effort for *Tetramesa* descriptions, where there is a strong Northern-Hemisphere bias.

(2) GRASS DISTRIBUTIONS IN NATIVE AND INVADED RANGES   
These maps show the distributions of a query grass species in its native and invasive range, using the GBIF database.

PART 9: SUMMARY BARPLOT FOR THE SPECIMENS COLLECTED    
This barplot shows how many wasp specimens were collected on each host grass of interest, and the province it was from.
